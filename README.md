# SDMCheck
## A GUI for checking sequencing results for site directed mutagenisis.

SDMCheck is a QT5 GUI built-in python for quickly and accurately verifying Site-Directed Mutations (SDMs) from Sanger sequencing data. SDMCheck allows you to align and compare multiple contigs to a template, easily spot intentional and unintentional mutations and quickly view the sequencing trace to validate the nucleotide read. Additionally, SDMCheck makes it easy to quickly save results in an organized fashion to allow users to keep consistent, accurate, and easily accessible records of their strain libraries.
